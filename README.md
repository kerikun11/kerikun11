### Ryotaro Onuki (a.k.a KERI or kerikun11)

I'm an embedded systems engineer in Japan.  
I like to make small and smart devices.  
As an example, I made [IR-Station](https://github.com/kerikun11/IR-Station), which is an IoT infrared remote controller.  
As a hobby, I participate in a robot competition called [micromouse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micromouse).
